TEST-SUITE  v1.0.0
------------------

You can run make with several options:

A) Run all PW and CP tests and show a final report

$ make


B) Run only PW tests and show a final report

$ make run-tests-pw 


C) Run only CP tests and show a final report

$ make run-tests-cp


D) Run the test that is in a single directory and show a final report

$ make run-custom-test testdir=name_of_directory

For example, the following runs only the tests in the pw_spinorbit directory
$ make run-custom-test testdir=pw_spinorbit


E) After computing all tests, it also run a comparison-only steps and redirect
   the output to a file called "out.`date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`" (python buffers both
   stdout and stderr)

$ make compare


F) Regenerate all benchmark reference files

$ make create_reference


G) Clean all test files create so far and leave only benchmark reference

$ make clean



REFERENCE OUTPUTS
-----------------

All reference outputs have been computed using GCC 4.9.2. The following 
configure options have been used:

./configure --disable-openmp --disable-parallel \
    --with-internal-blas --with-internal-lapack


KNOWN ISSUES
