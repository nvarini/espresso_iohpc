Things TODO in GIPAW
====================
1. Short term, small changes
  - clean hfi_extrapolation-related variables
  - fix ZORA in hyperfine
  - documentation and description of input variables
  - extract routines from gipaw_module
  - modify suscept_crystal to compute also EPR with ultrasoft
  - LDA+U in h_psiq
  - allocate j_ind and b_ind (induced current and field) only when needed
  - remove symmetry operations that do not map cartesian axes

2. Medium-term
  - write_fields: in raw format or NetCDF, for visualization
  - use bec_type everywhere
  - molecular method (no q-points): possible 6x speed increase
  - NMR for metals: orbital shift
  - NMR for metals: Knight shift
  - better core-relaxation (?)
  - hyperfine: orbital contribution

3. Long-term, requiring some effort
  - ZORA for NMR
  - converse-NMR and converse-EPR
  - linear response with hybrids
  - "on-the-fly" pseudopotentials (?)
  - J-couplings
  - relaxation time in solids (?)


DONE
====
- EFG (tested on quartz) and hyperfine (untested) with ultrasoft
- NMR with ultrasoft
- f-sum rule works with ultrasoft
- EFG cleaned
- hyperfine cleaned
- hyperfine core-relaxation
- EPR g-tensor unified with NMR shielding
