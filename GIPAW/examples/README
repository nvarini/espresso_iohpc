This folder contains some examples of NMR and EPR calculations.

benzene-NCPP:  benzene NMR shielding using norm-conserving pseudopotentials
benzene-USPP:  benzene NMR shielding using ultrasoft pseudopotentials
quartz:        NMR shdielding and EFG of quartz
H2O+:          EPR g-tensor and hyperfine couplings of H2O^+ radical

The quartz example shows a limitation of the GIPAW formalism: symmetry
operations that do not map cartesian axes are not allowed. If you have
a triclinc cell, remove all symmetries (nosym = .true.). In the special
case of an hexagonal cell, you can use ibrav = 0 and orient the cell
like in the quartz examples. The keyword 'CELL_PARAMETERS cubic' prevent
the code to detect 60 degrees rotations, which are incompatible with
GIPAW.
