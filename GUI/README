 ==============================================================================


This directory contains the (1) PWgui: a Graphical-User-Interface for
PWscf and (2) QE-modes package: a collection of Emacs major-modes for
Quantum ESPRESSO input files.


Info about the PWgui and its directory structure:

  1. PWgui/ -- the GUI itself
  2. Guib/  -- the engine that the PWgui uses

The PWgui GUI is based on Guib engine (see
http://www-k3.ijs.si/kokalj/guib/guib.html). Currently, the Guib
engine is also included in QE repository (espresso/GUI/Guib
directory).


IMPORTANT: 
**********

	1. Enter the PWgui/ directory and read the following files:
			INSTALL.svn      (REQUIRED)
			INSTALL          (optional)
			README           (optional)
			README.developer (optional)

	2. The Guib/ directory can be treated as "technicalities", and
	   except you want to develop Guib, you do not need to enter ever
	   in that directory
