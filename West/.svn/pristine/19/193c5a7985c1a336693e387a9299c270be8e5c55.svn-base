These are instructions on how to run the examples for WEST package.

These examples try to exercise all the programs and features
of the PW package.

If you find that any relevant feature isn't being tested,
please contact us (or even better, write and send us a new example).

To run the examples, you should follow this procedure:

1) Edit the "environment_variables" file from THIS directory,
   setting the following variables as needed:

     BIN_DIR = directory where executables reside
     PSEUDO_DIR = directory where pseudopotential files reside
     TMP_DIR = directory to be used as temporary storage area

   If you have downloaded the full ESPRESSO distribution, you may set
   BIN_DIR=$TOPDIR/bin and PSEUDO_DIR=$TOPDIR/pseudo, where $TOPDIR is
   the root of the ESPRESSO source tree.

   TMP_DIR must be a directory you have read and write access to, with
   enough available space to host the temporary files produced by the
   example runs, and possibly offering high I/O performance (i.e.,
   don't use an NFS-mounted directory).

2) You have to specify a driver program (such as "poe" or "mpirun")
   and the number of processors. This can be done by editing PARA_PREFIX
   and PARA_POSTFIX variables (in the "environment_variables" file).
   Parallel executables will be run by a command like this:

     $PARA_PREFIX pw.x $PARA_POSTFIX < file.in > file.out

   For example, if the command line is like this (as for an IBM SP):

     poe pw.x -procs 4 < file.in > file.out

   you should set PARA_PREFIX="poe", PARA_POSTFIX="-procs 4".

   Ask your system administrator
   for instructions.

3) To run a single example, go to the corresponding directory (for
   instance, "example/example01") and execute:

     ./run_example

   This will create a subdirectory "results", containing the input and
   output files generated by the calculation.

   Some examples take only a few seconds to run, while others may
   require several minutes depending on your system.

4) In each example's directory, the "reference" subdirectory contains
   verified output files, that you can check your results against.

   The reference results were generated on a local cluster.
   On different architectures the precise numbers could be slightly
   different, in particular if different FFT dimensions are
   automatically selected.  For this reason, a plain "diff" of your
   results against the reference data doesn't work, or at least, it 
   requires human inspection of the results.

                   LIST AND CONTENT OF THE EXAMPLES

For each example, more detailed information is provided by the README file 
contained in the corresponding directory.

example01:
    This example shows how to use pw.x, wstat.x and wfreq.x to compute 
    the GW electronic structure for SiH4. 
    The input parameters have not been converged in order to yield a quick 
    simulation time for testing purposes only. 

example02:
    This example shows how to use pw.x, wstat.x and wfreq.x to compute 
    the GW electronic structure for H2O.
    The input parameters have not been converged in order to yield a quick 
    simulation time for testing purposes only.
