     atom    1 type  1   force =     0.00013888    0.00000000    0.00000000
     atom    2 type  1   force =    -0.00013888    0.00000000    0.00000000

     Total force =     0.000196     Total SCF correction =     0.000000

     bfgs converged in   4 scf cycles and   2 bfgs steps
     (criteria: energy <  1.0E-04, force <  1.0E-03)
