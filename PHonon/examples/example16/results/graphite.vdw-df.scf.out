     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = VDW-DF ( 1  4  4  0 1 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =      -7.16846337 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      11.99234894 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -14.43286556 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -36.26917740 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  13 iterations
