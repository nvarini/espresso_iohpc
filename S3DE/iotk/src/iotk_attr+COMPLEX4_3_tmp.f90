! CONFIGURATION FILE FOR IOTK 1.1.0 for Quantum-Espresso
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!
! The following lines map some commonly defined system macro to the internal
! iotk macros.
! Iotk macros which are not defined take their default values.
! See the manual for a list of iotk macros.


! Generic options valid for quantum-espresso
! QE uses ranks up to four and default integer/logicals only


! some compilers do not like the following
!    #define __IOTK_REAL1 selected_real_kind(6,30)
!    #define __IOTK_REAL2 selected_real_kind(14,200)
! so we use explicit kinds

! Something from an ancient past that probably is not valid anymore...
! #if defined(__NAG)
! #   define __IOTK_REAL1 1
! #   define __IOTK_REAL2 2
! #else

! Machine-dependent options
! Only for compilers that require some special tricks

    !
    ! proceed with a machine dependent def where available
    !



!------------------------------------------------------------------------------!



! The macros are defined with -D option or inside iotk_config.h
! The default values are set here

! Maximum rank of an array

! Minimum value used in iotk_free_unit

! Maximum value used in iotk_free_unit

! Unit for errors

! Unit for output

! Kind for header in binary files

! Maximum number of arguments to the iotk tool

! Character (or eventually string) for newline
! It may be adjusted for particular systems
! It is used only in binary files, surrounding the tags so that they can
! be easily isolated with grep
! Unix    achar(10)
! Mac-OS  achar(13)
! Windows ? (now it should be a single byte)

! Character for EOS

! These are the default kinds, which depend on the options used
! during the library compilation
! Only default characters are implemented
! For logical, integer and real types, the c precompiler
! looks for defined kinds. If no kind is found, the default
! is used as __IOTK_type1

! Complex are treated indentically to reals
! These lines map the definitions.

! Some useful check follow
